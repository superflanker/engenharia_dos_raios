\ProvidesPackage{uicfont}[2023/05/28]
\usepackage{iftex}


\ifpdftex
% pdfLaTeX does not support directly embedding OpenType fonts
% We will therefore use fonts from the LaTeX font catalogue
% https://tug.org/FontCatalogue
% These fonts are pdfLaTeX ready
% We use OpenSans as Sans Serif and Caladea as the Serif font
\usepackage[defaultsans,scale=0.9]{opensans} % replaces default sans-serif font
\usepackage{caladea} % replaces default serif font
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\fi


\ifxetex
% XeLaTeX directly supports OpenType fonts
% Use XeLaTeX if you would like more options with fonts
% We use OpenSans as Sans Serif and IBM Plex Serif as the Serif font
% We also augment them with Playfair Display SC for the Small Caps Style.
\usepackage{fontspec}
% The commands \setsansfont, \setmainfont and \setmonofont are provided by the fontspec package.
% These commands provide a very fine grained control over fonts.
% e.g. OpenSans does not provide SmallCapsFont, so we will augment it with Playfair Display SC for the Small Caps Style.
% Small Caps style is used in the pseudocode.

% By default Beamer uses Sans-Serif mode and the font specified in \setsansfont is the font that will be applied in most places.
\setsansfont{OpenSans}[
    Path=./fonts/,
    Scale=0.9,
    Extension = .ttf,
    UprightFont=Open_Sans/*-Regular,
    BoldFont=Open_Sans/*-Bold,
    ItalicFont=Open_Sans/*-Italic,
    BoldItalicFont=Open_Sans/*-BoldItalic,
    SmallCapsFont=Playfair_Display_SC/PlayfairDisplaySC-Regular % OpenSans does not have an SC variant
]
% Other less common font styles are SlantedFont, BoldSlantedFont, SwashFont and BoldSwashFont.
% If your font also provides additional faces (e.g. ExtraLight, etc), fontspec also supports them.
% Please see the fontspec documentation Section 4.3 (Choosing additional NFSS font faces) for details.

% This is used if we use \usefonttheme{serif} in main.tex
% With the default \usefonttheme[onlymath]{serif}, this will control the font used for math
\setmainfont{IBMPlexSerif}[
    Path=./fonts/,
    Scale=0.9,
    Extension = .ttf,
    UprightFont=IBM_Plex_Serif/*-Regular,
    BoldFont=IBM_Plex_Serif/*-Bold,
    ItalicFont=IBM_Plex_Serif/*-Italic,
    BoldItalicFont=IBM_Plex_Serif/*-BoldItalic,
    SmallCapsFont=Playfair_Display_SC/PlayfairDisplaySC-Regular % IBMPlexSerif does not have an SC variant
]

% This controls verbatim text (i.e. code)
\setmonofont{NotoSansMono}[
    Path=./fonts/Noto_Sans_Mono/,
    Scale=0.9,
    Extension = .ttf,
    UprightFont=*-Regular
]
